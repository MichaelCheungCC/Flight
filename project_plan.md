## Project Plan


#### Motivation

This project is motivated by an online discussion on highly fluctuated price of flight ticket. Also, travelling and flight ticket nowadays are hot topics. Therefore, I initiated this project to build ETL pipelines for analytical purpose. Other motivation includes: 

- Learning through a real life scenario
- Showcasing my data engineering skills
- Sense of success
- Topics for Medium Story and daily conversations


#### Skill Sets Demonstrated

- Web Scraping
- ETL Pipelines
- Data Warehousing
- Schema Design and Data Modelling
- SQL
- AWS Cloud Architecture
- Python
- Error Handling and Retry Mechanism
- Statiscal Modelling
- Git Version Control
- Project Planning

If possible:
- Machine Learning
- Data Visualization
- Frontend and Backend Development

#### Solution Architecture


#### End Deliverables
- Low price flight ticket email notifications
- Predictive analytics on price of flight ticket
- Analytics on flight punctuality

If possible:
- Machine Learning Models
- Dashboard for data visualization
- Websites for query


#### Limitations
- Data volume is not high (cost of cloud service)
- Web scraping during sales promotion is not that feasible
- One adult, economy class, direct flight selection is used   


#### Data Source Used
